# calculator-in-python

This is another practice project, in this case: a calculator. It does not perform complex operations such as trinomials, much less calculate trigonometric ratios. It is only for simple calculations.
It is worth clarifying that Python itself can be used as a calculator simply by typing python in cmd or powershell or the Linux terminal. Only this calculator generates an interface in the terminal to be more sociable with the client.
